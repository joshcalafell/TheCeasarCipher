Abstract
--------
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. This is a Ruby implementation of Ceasar's cipher.

TODO
----
Simplify code, make corrections, correct spelling (my t key is broken, and strikes twice right now...), make commentts better. I would like to recreate this in C, PHP, JavaScript, and Java. Other languages would be cool too if anyone is interested in helping with this. Also, I would like to add an interpolate method that either guesses at the shift given a ciphertext, or allows a user to cycle through shiftfs in real time, producing the plaintext for each shift, until the user sees a string that makes sense. Also, I would like to add a GUI eitther in this implemetation, or in different languages. Basically, it's a work in progress. Fell free to fork to your own repository, or request to be made a partner on this project through email. :) -RF
